Usage: pandahook build MODULE [arg...]
--------------------------------------------
Follow any command with "help" for more information.

BUILD automates the process of writing githook scripts. Compared to the other
commands, build has the most options.  That's why it is further subdivided into
"modules" that give us flexibility.

For example:  Say we need a githook that restarts a service on a CoreOS cluster,
so our githook makes use of fleetctl.  But that only applies to projects that
use CoreOS. Another technology stack will need a completely different set of
commands to do the same thing.

The BUILD command abstracts the steps needed to (in this example) restart a
deployment, and bundles unique dependency calls (like fleetctl) into "modules"
that can be specified in its options.
